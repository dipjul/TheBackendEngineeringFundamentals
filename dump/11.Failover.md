### **Failover**

#### **1. Core Concept**

**Failover** is an automatic process in a high-availability (HA) system where a standby component (server, network, storage, service) takes over the operations of a failed primary component. The primary goal is to minimize downtime and maintain service continuity without manual intervention.

*   **Analogy:** A spare tire in a car. When the primary tire fails (goes flat), you switch to the spare to continue your journey, albeit potentially with some limitations (e.g., speed, distance).

#### **2. Key Objectives**

*   **High Availability (HA):** To ensure applications and services are operational and accessible with minimal disruption, often measured as a percentage of uptime (e.g., 99.999% or "five nines").
*   **Disaster Recovery (DR):** To recover systems and data after a catastrophic event, often involving a secondary geographic location. Failover is a key action within a DR plan.
*   **Business Continuity:** To maintain critical business functions during and after a failure.

#### **3. Key Components & Terminology**

*   **Primary/Active Node:** The system currently handling the production workload.
*   **Secondary/Standby/Passive Node:** The system that remains on standby, ready to take over if the primary fails.
    *   **Hot Standby:** Fully powered on, synchronized, and ready to take over immediately (fastest failover).
    *   **Warm Standby:** Powered on and partially synchronized, may take a short time to become current.
    *   **Cold Standby:** Powered off and requires manual intervention, configuration, and data restoration (slowest failover).
*   **Failback:** The process of returning operations to the original (now repaired) primary system after a failover has occurred. This can be automated or manual.
*   **Heartbeat (or Health Check):** A continuous signal sent between nodes to indicate they are alive and healthy.
*   **Quorum:** A voting mechanism to prevent "split-brain" scenarios (see below). It ensures only one cluster has a majority of votes and can become active.
*   **Virtual IP (VIP):** A floating IP address that is assigned to the active node. Clients connect to this VIP, which automatically moves to the standby node during a failover, making the transition transparent to the end-user.

#### **4. Types of Failover**

| Type | Description | Use Case | RTO* / RPO** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Automatic Failover** | System detects failure and switches without human intervention. | Mission-critical applications requiring maximum uptime. | Very Low RTO |
| **Manual Failover** | An administrator triggers the switchover. | Planned maintenance, testing, or less critical systems. | Higher RTO |
| **Instant Failover** | Near-zero downtime; state is continuously synchronized. | Financial trading systems, real-time databases. | Near-Zero RTO/RPO |
| **Graceful Failover** | The primary node gracefully hands off connections and state to the standby before shutting down. | Planned maintenance, upgrades. | Low RTO |
| **Disaster Recovery Failover** | Failover to a geographically distant site (geo-redundancy). | Recovery from natural disasters, regional outages. | Varies (minutes to hours) |

*   **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** The maximum acceptable time an application can be down.
*   **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** The maximum acceptable amount of data loss, measured in time.

#### **5. Common Challenges & Pitfalls**

*   **Split-Brain:** A catastrophic scenario where both the primary and secondary nodes believe they are active, often due to a faulty heartbeat connection. This can lead to data corruption. **Mitigation:** Use a quorum, reliable heartbeats, and fencing.
*   **Fencing (or STONITH - Shoot The Other Node In The Head):** The process of isolating a faulty node to prevent it from causing damage (like split-brain). This could mean cutting its power or network access.
*   **Data Synchronization Lag (Replication Lag):** The standby node might not have the very latest data from the primary at the moment of failure, leading to data loss (affecting RPO).
*   **Testing:** Failover systems are complex and must be tested regularly. A failover system that has never been tested is **guaranteed to fail** when needed.
*   **Performance Impact:** The standby node may have lower specifications, leading to degraded performance after a failover.
*   **DNS/Network Propagation:** Clients might cache the old server's IP address, delaying the redirection to the new active node.

#### **6. Best Practices**

1.  **Design for Failure:** Assume components will fail; build redundancy at every layer (application, database, network, power).
2.  **Automate Everything:** Prefer automatic failover for critical systems to avoid human delay and error.
3.  **Monitor and Test Relentlessly:** Continuously monitor heartbeats and replication status. Conduct regular, scheduled failover drills.
4.  **Implement Proper Fencing:** Always have a reliable fencing mechanism to avoid split-brain.
5.  **Clear Documentation:** Have a runbook that details the failover process, roles, and responsibilities for both automated and manual scenarios.
6.  **Understand Your RTO and RPO:** Your failover architecture should be designed to meet these business-defined objectives.
