### **Database Replication**

#### **1. What is Database Replication?**

Database replication is the process of copying and maintaining database objects (like tables, rows, etc.) in multiple databases that make up a distributed database system. The goal is to ensure that data is consistently and reliably available across different locations, servers, or data centers.

**Key Purposes:**
*   **High Availability:** If the primary database fails, a replica can take over with minimal downtime.
*   **Disaster Recovery:** Replicas in geographically distant locations protect against site-wide failures (natural disasters, power outages).
*   **Improved Performance:** Read operations can be distributed across multiple replica servers, reducing the load on the primary (source) database. This is often called **read scaling**.
*   **Reduced Latency:** Data can be replicated to a location geographically closer to the end-users, speeding up query response times.
*   **Analytics and Reporting:** Run heavy analytical queries on a replica without affecting the performance of the primary transactional database.

#### **2. Core Concepts & Terminology**

*   **Primary (Master/Source):** The main database where all write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) are first applied.
*   **Replica (Slave/Target):** A copy of the primary database that receives and applies data changes from the primary.
*   **Replication Lag:** The delay between a write operation on the primary and that operation being applied to a replica. This is a critical metric to monitor.
*   **Conflict Resolution:** Rules to determine which data change "wins" when the same data is modified in two different locations simultaneously (crucial in multi-primary setups).

### **3. Types of Database Replication**

Replication strategies can be categorized along several axes. The most common are based on **topology** and **synchronization**.

#### **A. Based on Synchronization (How data is copied)**

**1. Synchronous Replication**
*   **How it works:** A write transaction on the primary is only considered **complete** once it has been successfully written to both the primary *and* at least one replica.
*   **Pros:** Guarantees **zero data loss** if the primary fails. The replica is always an exact, up-to-date copy.
*   **Cons:** High latency for write operations, as the transaction waits for network round-trips to the replica(s). Performance degrades with distance or network issues. If a replica goes down, writes to the primary may also be blocked.
*   **Use Case:** Critical financial systems where data integrity is more important than speed.

**2. Asynchronous Replication**
*   **How it works:** A write transaction on the primary is considered **complete** as soon as it is written to the primary's local storage. The changes are then queued and sent to the replicas at a later time.
*   **Pros:** Very low latency for write operations on the primary. The primary is not affected by the performance or availability of the replicas.
*   **Cons:** Risk of **data loss**. If the primary fails before the queued changes are sent to the replicas, those recent writes are lost. Replicas are often slightly behind (replication lag).
*   **Use Case:** Most common setup. Ideal for read-scaling and disaster recovery where some minor data loss is acceptable.

**3. Semi-Synchronous Replication**
*   **How it works:** A hybrid approach. The primary waits for **acknowledgement** that at least one replica has *received* the data (not necessarily applied it) before committing the transaction. It's a balance between safety and performance.
*   **Pros:** Reduces the risk of data loss compared to async, but with lower latency impact than full sync.
*   **Cons:** More complex to configure. Still potential for minimal data loss if the primary fails right after sending the acknowledgement but before the replica applies the change.
*   **Use Case:** Environments that need stronger guarantees than async but cannot tolerate the performance hit of full sync.

#### **B. Based on Topology (The flow of data)**

**1. Single-Primary (Master-Slave) Replication**
*   **How it works:** There is only one primary database that accepts write operations. All replicas are read-only and receive a stream of changes from this single primary.
*   **Pros:** Simple to implement. Avoids write conflicts because all writes go to one place.
*   **Cons:** The primary is a single point of failure for writes. Write throughput is limited by the capacity of a single server.
*   **Use Case:** The standard and most widely used model for read-scaling.

**2. Multi-Primary (Master-Master) Replication**
*   **How it works:** Multiple nodes (primaries) can accept write operations. Each primary coordinates with the others to propagate its changes.
*   **Pros:** No single point of failure for writes. Enables write operations in different geographic regions with low latency.
*   **Cons:** Extremely complex. Requires sophisticated **conflict resolution** mechanisms (e.g., "last write wins," custom logic) to handle cases where the same data is written in two different locations. Increased risk of data inconsistencies.
*   **Use Case:** Collaborative applications (like Google Docs) or global applications where users need to write to their local region.

**3. Logical vs. Physical Replication**

*   **Physical Replication:** Copies the exact disk blocks and byte-by-byte changes from the primary to the replica. The replica is a **bit-for-bit identical copy** of the primary. (e.g., PostgreSQL Physical Replication, Oracle Data Guard).
    *   *Pros:* Very efficient, low overhead. The replica is always in a consistent state and can be used for failover.
    *   *Cons:* The primary and replica must be the same database version and often the same OS/architecture. The replica is an exact copy, so you can't replicate a subset of tables.

*   **Logical Replication:** Replicates changes based on the database's transaction log (Write-Ahead Log - WAL) but translates them into logical SQL statements (INSERT, UPDATE) that are executed on the replica.
    *   *Pros:* Flexible. You can replicate a subset of tables, filter data, or even replicate between different database versions. Useful for zero-downtime upgrades and data warehousing.
    *   *Cons:* Higher overhead than physical replication. More potential for conflicts and replication lag.
