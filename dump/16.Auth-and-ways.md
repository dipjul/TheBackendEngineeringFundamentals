### 1. Core Concept: Authentication vs. Authorization

The difference is fundamental to security and is often summarized as:

*   **Authentication (AuthN):** **Who are you?** The process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It's about proving you are who you say you are.
    *   **Analogy:** Showing your passport or driver's license at the airport check-in counter. The agent is verifying that you are the person whose name is on the ticket.

*   **Authorization (AuthZ):** **What are you allowed to do?** The process of determining what permissions, access rights, or resources an authenticated user has.
    *   **Analogy:** Your boarding pass after check-in. It specifies *what* you are allowed to do: which plane you can board (the resource), and whether you can access the first-class cabin (a privilege).

You **must always authenticate first** to establish an identity, and then **authorize** to determine what that identity can access.

| Aspect | Authentication (AuthN) | Authorization (AuthZ) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Purpose** | Verifies identity | Grants permissions |
| **Question** | "Who are you?" | "What are you allowed to do?" |
| **Process** | Credentials (password, biometrics) | Policies, Roles, Access Control Lists (ACLs) |
| **Example** | Logging into your email | Reading emails vs. changing account settings |
| **Data** | Manages Identity (e.g., User ID) | Manages Access (e.g., Roles, Permissions) |
| **Order** | Comes first | Comes after successful authentication |

### 2. Common Ways to Authenticate (AuthN Methods)

Authentication typically relies on one or more **factors**, which are categories of credentials.

#### The Three Factors of Authentication

1.  **Something You Know:** Knowledge factor (e.g., Password, PIN, Security Question).
2.  **Something You Have:** Possession factor (e.g., Smartphone (for an app), Security Key (YubiKey), Bank Card, Hardware Token).
3.  **Something You Are:** Inherence factor (e.g., Fingerprint, Facial recognition, Iris scan, Voice pattern).

Using more than one factor is called **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**, which is significantly more secure than single-factor (like just a password).

#### Specific Authentication Methods & Protocols

*   **Passwords:** The most common single-factor method. Vulnerable to phishing, brute-force attacks, and poor user habits (reuse, simple passwords).

*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA / 2FA):**
    *   **Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP):** Apps like Google Authenticator or Authy generate a temporary code. Combines something you know (password) with something you have (your phone).
    *   **SMS/Email Codes:** A code sent via SMS or email. **Note:** SMS-based 2FA is considered less secure due to SIM-swapping attacks but is better than nothing.
    *   **Push Notifications:** A service like Duo sends a push notification to an app on your phone for approval.
    *   **Security Keys:** Physical devices (e.g., YubiKey) that use protocols like FIDO2/WebAuthn for phishing-resistant authentication.

*   **Single Sign-On (SSO):**
    *   Allows a user to authenticate with one set of credentials (e.g., their company login) to access multiple independent applications.
    *   It **delegates** authentication to a trusted third party (called an Identity Provider or IdP).
    *   **Protocols:** **SAML** (common in enterprise), **OAuth 2.0** (the foundation for most social logins and modern API access), and **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** (an identity layer built *on top of* OAuth 2.0 that provides authentication).

*   **Passwordless Authentication:**
    *   Aims to replace the password entirely. Often uses a possession factor (a security key or authenticator app) or a magic link sent via email.
    *   **WebAuthn** is a core W3C standard enabling passwordless logins using biometrics or security keys.

*   **Biometric Authentication:**
    *   Uses the inherence factor (fingerprint, face ID). It's convenient but raises privacy concerns. The stored data is usually a mathematical representation (a hash) of your biometric data, not the raw data itself.

*   **Certificate-Based Authentication:**
    *   Uses digital certificates (like SSL/TLS certificates for websites) to identify users or machines. Common in corporate and government environments.

*   **API Keys:**
    *   A unique identifier used to authenticate a project or application calling an API. Not for human users, but for service-to-service communication. They are secrets that must be protected.

### 3. Common Ways to Authorize (AuthZ Models)

Once a user is authenticated, these models control their access:

*   **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** A list of permissions attached to an object (e.g., a file). The list defines which users or system processes can access the object and what operations (read, write, execute) they can perform.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Access rights are assigned to *roles* (e.g., "Admin," "Editor," "Viewer"), and users are assigned to these roles. This is very common and scalable for organizations.
*   **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** A more dynamic model. Access decisions are based on attributes (characteristics) of the user, resource, action, and environment.
    *   *Example:* "A `User` with the attribute `department=HR` can `read` a `Document` with the attribute `classification=Internal` only if the `environment` attribute `current-time` is between `9 AM and 5 PM`."
