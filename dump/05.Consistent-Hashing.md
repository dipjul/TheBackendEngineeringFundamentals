### **Consistent Hashing**

#### **1. The Problem: Naive Hashing & Rehashing**

*   **Traditional Approach:** In a distributed system (like a cache cluster with nodes A, B, C), a common way to assign a key (e.g., `user_123_profile`) to a node is to use the modulo operator: `hash(key) % number_of_nodes`.
*   **The Rehashing Catastrophe:** This works fine until a node is added or removed (e.g., node D joins or node B fails). The `number_of_nodes` changes, meaning `hash(key) % N` becomes `hash(key) % (N-1)` or `hash(key) % (N+1)`. This change causes **almost every key to be remapped** to a different node.
*   **Impact:** This massive remapping (rehashing) is disastrous for caches (cause of cache misses and a stampede on the database) and stateful systems (data becomes assigned to the wrong node).

#### **2. The Solution: Consistent Hashing - Core Idea**

Consistent Hashing is a special kind of hashing that minimizes the number of keys that need to be remapped when a hash table (or a node in a distributed system) is resized.

The core idea is to **map both keys and nodes onto the same abstract circle (a hash ring)**.

#### **3. How It Works: The Hash Ring**

1.  **Imagine a Circle:** Picture a circle that represents the entire possible output range of a hash function (e.g., from 0 to 2^128 - 1). This circle is called the **hash ring**.
2.  **Map Nodes onto the Ring:**
    *   Each node (e.g., its IP address `A`, `B`, `C`) is hashed to determine its position on the ring.
    *   This results in points for `A`, `B`, and `C` placed at random locations around the circle.
3.  **Map Keys onto the Ring:**
    *   Each data key (e.g., `user_123_profile`) is also hashed and placed on the same ring.
4.  **Locate the Responsible Node:**
    *   To find which node a key belongs to, start at the key's position on the ring and **walk clockwise** until you encounter the first node.
    *   That node is responsible for that key.

#### **4. Key Advantage: Minimal Reassignment on Node Changes**

*   **Adding a Node (e.g., `D`):** When a new node `D` is added, it gets placed at a random point on the ring. Only the keys that fall between `D` and the previous node (counter-clockwise) are moved from the next node (clockwise) to `D`. **The vast majority of keys are unaffected.**
*   **Removing a Node (e.g., `B` fails):** When node `B` is removed, only the keys that were assigned to `B` need to be reassigned. They get reassigned to the next node clockwise from `B`'s old position (in this case, `C`). **All other keys remain on their original nodes.**

This property is called **consistency**, hence the name.

#### **5. The Real-World Challenge: Non-Uniform Distribution & Virtual Nodes**

The basic approach has a flaw:
*   **Imbalanced Load:** If nodes are assigned to only a few points on the ring, they can end up responsible for very different-sized arcs of the circle. One node might get a huge chunk of keys, while another gets very few.
*   **Solution: Virtual Nodes (Vnodes):**
    *   Instead of mapping one physical node to one point on the ring, we map each physical node to **multiple points** on the ring.
    *   For example, instead of `A` being one point, it becomes 1000 "virtual nodes" (`A-1`, `A-2`, ..., `A-1000`) scattered across the ring. The same is done for `B` and `C`.
    *   **Benefits:**
        1.  **Load Balancing:** A physical node that is more powerful can be assigned more virtual nodes, giving it a larger share of the keys.
        2.  **Smoothness:** When a node is added/removed, its load (number of keys) is transferred evenly to/from many other nodes, not just one. This prevents hotspots.
    *   Virtually all production systems (Dynamo, Cassandra, etc.) use virtual nodes.

#### **6. Properties of Consistent Hashing**

*   **Minimal Reorganization:** Changes in the set of nodes cause minimal movement of keys. This is its primary goal.
*   **Load Balancing:** With virtual nodes, keys are distributed approximately evenly among physical nodes.
*   **Scalability:** The system can easily grow or shrink by adding/removing nodes with minimal impact.
*   **Decentralization:** No central coordinator is needed to decide key placement; any node can determine the correct location for a key using the same algorithm.

#### **7. Common Use Cases**

*   **Distributed Caching Systems:** Memcached, Redis Cluster.
*   **Distributed Data Stores:** Amazon DynamoDB, Apache Cassandra, Riak.
*   **Load Balancers:** To direct client requests to a specific application server in a stateful manner (sticky sessions).
*   **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):** To route requests to the nearest edge server.

### **Analogy: The Dinner Table**

Imagine a circular dinner table (the hash ring) with 12 seats (hash positions). Dishes of food are the keys.

*   **Initial Setup:** Three chefs (nodes) sit at seats 12, 4, and 8. Each chef is responsible for all dishes placed on the table clockwise from their position until the next chef.
*   **Serving a Dish:** You want to place a pizza (a key). You calculate its "hash" â€“ it belongs at seat 2. You walk clockwise and find the first chef at seat 4. Chef at seat 4 gets the pizza.
*   **A Chef Leaves:** The chef at seat 4 leaves. Only the dishes between seat 12 and seat 4 (which belonged to the leaving chef) need a new home. They are now assigned to the next chef clockwise, the one at seat 8. The dishes assigned to chefs at 8 and 12 remain untouched.
*   **A Chef Joins:** A new chef sits at seat 10. The dishes between seat 8 and seat 10, which previously belonged to the chef at seat 12, are now assigned to the new chef at seat 10. The rest are unchanged.
