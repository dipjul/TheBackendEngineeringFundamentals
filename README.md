# The Backend Engineering Fundamentals

### OSI Model
  Open System Interconnection by International Organization for Standardization in 1984. It provides a framework for creating and implementing networking standards, devices, and internetworking schemes.
  | Group  | Layer No. | Layer Name  | Description |
  | ------ | --------- | ----------- | ----------- |
  | Top Layers | 7 |	Application |	Provide a user interface for sending and receiving data |
  | - | 6	| Presentation |	Encrypt, format, and compress data for transmission |
  | - | 5	| Session |	Initiate and terminate a session with the remote system |
  | Bottom Layers |	4 |	Transport |	Break the data stream into smaller segments and provide reliable and unreliable data delivery |
  | - | 3	| Network	| Provide logical addressing |
  | - | 2	| Data Link	| Prepare data for transmission |
  | - | 1	| Physical |	Move data between devices |
  #### Application Layer
  The Top layer of the OSI model is the application layer. It provides the protocols and services that are required by the network-aware applications to connect to the network. FTP, TFTP, POP3, SMTP, and HTTP are examples of standards and protocols used in this layer.
  #### Presentation Layer
  Conversion, compression, and encryption are the main functions that the Presentation layer performs on the sending computer while on the receiving computer these functions are reconversion, decompression, and decryption. ASCII, BMP, GIF, JPEG, WAV, AVI, and MPEG are examples of standards and protocols that work in this layer.
  #### Session Layer
  The session layer is responsible for establishing, managing, and terminating communications between two computers. RPCs and NFS are examples of the session layer.
  #### Transport Layer
  The main functionalities of the Transport layer are segmentation, data transportation, and connection multiplexing. For data transportation, it uses TCP and UDP protocols. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol. It provides reliable data delivery.
  #### Network Layer
  Defining logical addresses and finding the best path to reach the destination address are the main functions of this layer. Routers work in this layer. Routing also takes place in this layer. IP, IPX, and AppleTalk are examples of this layer.
  #### Data Link Layer
  Defining physical addresses, finding hosts in the local network, specifying standards and methods to access the media are the primary functions of this layer. Switching takes place in this layer. Switches and Bridges work in this layer. HDLC, PPP, and Frame Relay are examples of this layer.
  
  This layer has two sub-layers: MAC(Media Access Control) and LLC(Logical Link Control)
  #### Physical Layer
  The Physical Layer mainly defines standards for media and devices that are used to move data across the network. 10BaseT, 10Base100, CSU/DSU, DCE, and DTE are examples of the standards used in this layer.

### TCP/IP
  TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol. TCP/IP Stack is specifically designed as a model to offer highly reliable and end-to-end byte stream over an unreliable internetwork

  TCP/IP model is developed by ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network).
  Some widely used most common TCP/IP protocol are:

  #### TCP:
  Transmission Control Protocol is an internet protocol suite which breaks up the message into TCP Segments and reassembling them at the receiving side.

  #### IP:
  An Internet Protocol address that is also known as an IP address is a numerical label. It is assigned to each device that is connected to a computer network which uses the IP for communication. Its routing function allows internetworking and essentially establishes the Internet. Combination of IP with a TCP allows developing a virtual connection between a destination and a source.

  #### HTTP:
  The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is a foundation of the World Wide Web. It is used for transferring webpages and other such resources from the HTTP server or web server to the web client or the HTTP client. Whenever you use a web browser like Google Chrome or Firefox, you are using a web client. It helps HTTP to transfer web pages that you request from the remote servers.

  #### SMTP:
  SMTP stands for Simple mail transfer protocol. This protocol supports the e-mail is known as a simple mail transfer protocol. This protocol helps you to send the data to another e-mail address.

  #### SNMP:
  SNMP stands for Simple Network Management Protocol. It is a framework which is used for managing the devices on the internet by using the TCP/IP protocol.

  #### DNS:
  DNS stands for Domain Name System. An IP address that is used to identify the connection of a host to the internet uniquely. However, users prefer to use names instead of addresses for that DNS.

  #### TELNET:
  TELNET stands for Terminal Network. It establishes the connection between the local and remote computer. It established connection in such a manner that you can simulate your local system at the remote system.

  #### FTP:
  FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. It is a mostly used standard protocol for transmitting the files from one machine to another.

### IP Address
An Internet Protocol address (IP address) serves two main functions: network interface identification and location addressing.
IPv4 defines an IP address as a 32-bit number. However, because of the growth of the Internet and the depletion of available IPv4 addresses, a new version of IP i.e., IPv6, using 128 bits for the IP address, was standardized in 1998.

<hr>

### NAT
  Network address translation (NAT) is a method of mapping an IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device. The technique was originally used to bypass the need to assign a new address to every host when a network was moved, or when the upstream Internet service provider was replaced, but could not route the network's address space. It has become a popular and essential tool in conserving global address space in the face of IPv4 address exhaustion. One Internet-routable IP address of a NAT gateway can be used for an entire private network.

#### Routing
Network address translation can be used to mitigate IP address overlap. Address overlap occurs when hosts in different networks with the same IP address space try to reach the same destination host. This is most often a misconfiguration and may result from the merger of two networks or subnets, especially when using RFC 1918 private network addressing. The destination host experiences traffic apparently arriving from the same network, and intermediate routers have no way to determine where reply traffic should be sent to. The solution is either renumbering to eliminate overlap or network address translation.

#### Load balancing
In clientâ€“server applications, load balancers forward client requests to a set of server computers to manage the workload of each server. Network address translation may be used to map a representative IP address of the server cluster to specific hosts that service the request.

### Virtual IP Addressing
A virtual IP address (VIP or VIPA) is an IP address that does not correspond to a physical network interface.

Uses for VIPs include network address translation (especially, one-to-many NAT), fault-tolerance, and mobility. It advertises virtual links connected via itself to all of its actual network interfaces.

### iptables
iptables allows a system administrator to configure the IP packet filter rules of the Linux kernel firewall. The filters are organized in different tables, which contain chains of rules for how to treat network traffic packets. Different kernel modules and programs are currently used for different protocols. On most Linux systems, iptables is installed as /usr/sbin/iptables and documented in its man pages.

### TCP & UDP
TCP, which stands for Transmission Control Protocol, and UDP, or User Datagram Protocol, are part of the internet protocol suite, layer 4 (Transport). TCP and UDP are different methods to send information across the internet.

#### TCP Pros
- acknowledgement
- guranteed delivery
- connection based
- congestion control
- ordered packets

#### TCP Cons
- larger packets
- more bandwidth
- slower than UDP
- stateful
- server memory (DoS)

#### UDP Pros
- smaller package
- less bandwidth
- faster than TCP
- stateless

#### UDP Cons
- no acknowledgement
- no guranteed delivery
- connectionless
- no congestion control
- no ordered packets
- no security

### When to use UDP vs TCP?
When data integrity is your top priority, then TCP will always be the best choice. The protocol guarantees complete delivery and accurate reconstruction of the original data. When streaming video, however, accuracy is less important than continuity. This is why real-time applications like audio and video streaming will often use UDP.
<hr>

### Stateless vs Stateful applications
In a traditional stateful web application, the server is doing all of the work associated with recreating a web page. A stateless application doesn't save any client session (state) data on the server where the application lives. By using a Representational State Transfer (REST) API, developers can augment HTTP to produce stateless apps.

When an application is stateful, it relies on saved client session data to process new transactions. A stateful app still uses a database for back-end storage, but it also uses the server where the application runs to store data from previous interactions. This allows the app to process subsequent transactions in the context of preceding ones. Stateful systems use databases like any application, but they also maintain "state data" (related to client authentication and past requests) on the server itself. Stateful apps are fast because they don't need to process as much data in each client request. This makes stateful apps fast and it allows clients to interact with the application within the historical context of previous interactions.

Stateful apps bind clients and users to the same server so it can process subsequent requests in the context of previous ones. Stateful apps work best under predictable workloads that the system can manage. If traffic grows, you can't simply replicate a stateful app and redirect new client requests because users will need to start from scratch. This makes stateful apps more prone to system unavailability when client traffic increases.

A stateless application or stateless process doesn't store any data related to past transactions on its server. It accepts each transaction or user interaction like a blank slate without knowledge of previous interactions. Similar to a Coke machine, the stateless app receives a single short-term request and delivers a single response. This is why many of the apps (clients) on your phone or computer have a cache. A stateless system acts like a nameless agent that clients use to interact with the databases it connects with.

Since the application is stateless, a load balancer can infinitely replicate new instances of it and balance client requests across those instances. This allows the system to scale and manage any level of traffic. Similar to the security guard, DreamFactory waits for a client to submit an API request.

The decision to use stateful versus stateless apps boils down to your scalability requirements and what you need the app to do. If your app needs to store session data to process transactions in-context and if the server can handle the expected processing load, a stateful system is probably best. On the other hand, if you are building an app that needs to process REST API transactions, provide information in response to client requests â€“ and traffic levels can grow exponentially â€“ a stateless app is what youâ€™ll be working with.
